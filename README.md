This repository is updated frequently to reflect my preparation for software engineering interviews in 2020. 

## Data Structures
#### Internal Implementations
* Resizable array
* Queue and stack (circular array / linked list)
* HashMap (seperate chaining)
* Binary heap 

#### Alternative Representations
* Serialize and deserialize trees (Regular / BST)

## Algorithms
#### Binary Search
* Classical binary search
* Find first occurrence
* Find last occurrence 
* Search in 2D matrix
* Search in shifted sorted array
* Search in bitonic array
* Median of two sorted arrays
* K closest in sorted array
* K closest in two sorted arrays

#### Sorting Algorithms
* Selection sort (array / two stacks)
* Merge sort (array / linked list)
* Quick sort

#### Pointer and pivot
* Move 0s to the end (order not maintained / maintained)
* Dutch national flag problem

#### Linked List
* Reverse linked list (reverse all / two at a time / k at a time)
* Middle node
* Cycle (cycle existence / cycle position)
* Reorder list
* Partition list
* List palindromicity 
* Merge sorted lists (two lists / k lists)
* Linked list arithmetics (addition / subtraction)

#### Stacks and queues
* Queue by two stacks
* Stack by queues
* Min stack
* Deque by three stacks

#### Trees 
* Tree properties (height / balanced / complete / symmetric / is binary search tree)
* Tree iterative traversals (preorder / inorder / postorder)
* Binary search tree basic operations (search / insert / delete)
* Build trees based on traversals
* Least Common Ancestor problems (without parent pointer / with parent pointer)

#### Heaps and Best First Search
* Kth problem (Kth smallest in unsorted array, Kth closest points to origin in 3D)
* Bipartite graph

#### Depth First Search
* Subsets
* Permutations (numbers / valid parentheses)
* Combinations
* Coin change
* N Queens

#### Strings
* Top K frequent words
* Remove adjacent repeated characters
* Substring problem (check existence / replacement)
* String manipulation (compression / decompression / abbreviation)
* All anagrams
* Longest substring without repeating characters

#### Dynamic Programming
* Subarray and subsequence (ascending / sum)
* Cost of cutting rope
* Array hopper (can reach destination / minimum jumps)
* Word break problem
* Edit distance
* Largest enclosed area (square of 1s / ...)

## Java Language
* Final, finalize, finally
* Static
* Abstract class vs. interface
* Overload vs. Override
* Comparable and Comparator

## Object-Oriented Design


## System Design
